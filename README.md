# Image Classification with Python and TensorFlow
This is a simple Python script that uses the TensorFlow library and a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images.

## Requirements
This script requires the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pillow

You can install these with pip by running:
''' pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow '''

## Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command line and provide the path to the image you want to classify as a command-line argument.

For example:
''' python classify.py path_to_your_image.jpg '''

This will output the top 5 predictions for what the model thinks the image contains, along with the model's confidence for each prediction.

## Example Output**
Here's an example of what the output might look like:
'''
Golden Retriever: 95.67%
Labrador Retriever: 3.01%
Otterhound: 0.87%
Tibetan Mastiff: 0.25%
Great Pyrenees: 0.12%
'''
